  Doubly Linked List Programs ‚Äì DSA

This repository contains **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** programs that demonstrate various operations on **Doubly Linked Lists**. Each file focuses on a specific operation such as insertion, deletion, and traversal. These are foundational concepts in DSA used in technical interviews and academic learning.



## üìÑ List of Programs

| File Name                                  | Description |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `insertion_at_begin_backtraverse`         | Inserts nodes at the **beginning** of the doubly linked list and performs **backward traversal**. |
| `insertion_at_end_backtraverse`           | Inserts nodes at the **end** of the list and performs **backward traversal**. |
| `delete_operation_by_value`               | Deletes a node from the list by matching a **specific value**. |
| `deletion_at_beginning`                   | Deletes a node from the **beginning** of the list. |
| `delete_at_end`                           | Deletes a node from the **end** of the list. |
| `insert_at_end_delete_at_beginning`       | Inserts nodes at the **end**, then deletes from the **beginning**. |
| `insert_at_end_delete_at_end`             | Inserts nodes at the **end**, then deletes from the **end**. |



 Key Concepts Covered

- Doubly Linked List structure
- Insertion at beginning and end
- Deletion by value, at beginning, and at end
- Forward and backward traversal
